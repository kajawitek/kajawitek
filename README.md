# Hello there! 👋 I'm Kaja Witek

Hi! After years of experience in finance analysis, where I extensively used Excel and experimented with Python, and trafficking digital campaigns, I'm venturing into the vibrant world of Ruby on Rails development. 🚀

## 🌱 Journey So Far

- Started my Ruby on Rails learning journey in 2022 with [nerds.family](https://nerds.family/), where I had the amazing opportunity to create my project: [Employee Recognition Platform](https://github.com/kajawitek/employee-recognition-platform-1649436267).
- This experience in RoR has been more intriguing than all my previous roles.
- Continuously exploring new RoR concepts and techniques, both independently and with the help of my mentor (and husband) - [piowit](https://github.com/piowit).

## 🤝 Networking

- Always keen to meet and interact with experienced developers.
- Regularly attend Ruby meetups ([PLRUG Warsaw](https://www.meetup.com/nerdsclub/)) and conferences ([Ruby Warsaw Community Conference](https://www.meetup.com/nerdsclub/events/294574789/), [WrocLove.rb](https://wrocloverb.com/)). If you're around, don't hesitate to say hi! 👋
- Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kajawitek/).

## 🌼 Personal Interests

- 🌿 Gardening is my retreat. My goal is to make my garden the ultimate relaxation spot. 
- 🌍 An enthusiastic traveler. Always looking for unconventional ways to explore our beautiful world.
- 🍲 Culinary adventures are my thing. Love cooking and experimenting with new recipes. 
- 🃏 Magic The Gathering enthusiast. Let's duel if you're up for it! 





Thanks for stopping by! Wishing you a productive coding session! 💻
